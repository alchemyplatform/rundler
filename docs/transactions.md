## Bundle Transaction Submission

There are three types of senders that we have implemented to propagate bundles on to the chain. 

- `RawTransactionSender`
  - This sender will send the bundle as an `eth_sendRawTransaction`, so each of the transactions will need to be signed 
    before sending the bundle to the node url provided. 
- `ConditionalTransactionSender` 
  - This sender will send the bundle as an `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional`, so each of the transactions will need to
    be signed before sending the bundle to the node url provided.
- `FlashbotsTransactionSender`
  - This sender will send the bundle as an `eth_sendBundle`, so each of the transactions will need to be signed before
    sending the bundle to the flashbots protect relay url. This allows the transaction to be protected from frontrunning attacks, however
    it is only available on `mainnet`, `goerli` and `sepolia`. 

When a bundle is submitted, we wait 2 blocks to see if the transaction has been mined. If the transaction has not 
been mined within `BUILDER_MAX_BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_MINE` blocks, we increase the gas fees `BUILDER_REPLACEMENT_FEE_PERCENT_INCREASE`
percent. We repeat this process until the transaction either lands on chain or we increase the fee over `BUILDER_REPLACEMENT_FEE_PERCENT_INCREASE`  
times and in that case the transaction will be set as stalled in the `StalledAtMaxFeeIncreases` status.
