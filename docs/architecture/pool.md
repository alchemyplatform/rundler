# Pool Task

The `Pool` task is responsible for receiving, validating, sorting, and storing user operations. The `RPC` task submits the UOs from users and the `Builder` task consumes the UOs for bundling.

## Simulation

Upon each `add_operation` call the `Pool` will preforms a series of checks.

1. Run a series of [prechecks](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/eip/EIPS/eip-4337.md#client-behavior-upon-receiving-a-useroperation) to catch any reasons why the UO may not be mined. 

2. Simulate the UO via a `debug_traceCall` as per the [ERC-4337 spec](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/eip/EIPS/eip-4337.md#simulation).

If violations are found, the UO is rejected. Else, the UO is added to the pool. 

### Tracer

A typescript based tracer is used to collect relevant information from the `debug_traceCall`. It is compiled into javascript in this repo and sent as a string as a parameter to the trace.

## Reputation

The `Pool` tracks the reputation of entities as per the [ERC-4337 spec](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/eip/EIPS/eip-4337.md#reputation-scoring-and-throttlingbanning-for-global-entities).


### Allowlist/Blocklist

The `Pool` supports allowlists and blocklists configured via a JSON file. The JSON file must contain an array of addresses to add to the list.

Example file:
```
[
    "0xasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf"
]
```

**Allowlist**: Addresses on this list are always `Ok` in the reputation manager.

**Blocklist**: Addresses on this list are always `Banned` in the reputation manager.

## Chain Tracking

The `Pool` uses a JSON-RPC provider to track the progression of its chain. The chain tracker notifies the pool of new blocks, mined user operations, and "un-mined" user operations due to chain re-orgs.

Upon receiving a chain update event, the `Pool` will update its internal state by removing any mined user operations (and placing them in its cache), and by replacing any un-mined user operations (from its cache).

The `Pool`'s cache depth is configurable, if a re-org occurs that is deeper than the cache, UOs will be unable to be returned to the pool.

## Mempool Sharding

The `Pool` supports a very simple sharding scheme in its `best_operations` interface. The `Pool` is configured with a `num_shards` config, and the caller of `best_operations` provides a `shard_index` parameter.

User operations are assigned to a shard by their sender address modulo the number of shards.

Callers can use this feature to ensure that multiple callers are returned a disjoint set of user operations by sender. Callers should ensure that there is exactly 1 caller assigned to each shard index, else risk bundle invalidations (> 1 assigned) or orphaned user operations (0 assigned).

## Alternative Mempools (in preview)

**NOTE: this feature presents known risks to the bundler, use at your own risk.**

The `Pool` supports configuring [alternative mempools](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#alternative-mempools) via a JSON configuration file. This feature is under development with the community and will be modified soon.

See [here](https://hackmd.io/@dancoombs/BJYRz3h8n) for more details.

Example config:

```
{
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000": {
    "description": "Allow list",
    "chainIds": ["0x066eed"],
    "allowlist": [
      {
        "description": "My Factory",
        "rule": "notStaked",
        "entity": "0xasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## P2P

P2P mempool implementation is under development. See [here](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler-spec/blob/main/p2p-specs/p2p-interface.md) for spec details.
